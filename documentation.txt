Project Documentation: Ad Balance Scraper and Alert System

Overview:
    This system collects ad balance data from various advertising platforms, 
    processes it, and sends alerts when certain thresholds are met. 
    It consists of three main components:

Scraper: 
    Collects ad balance data from platforms using API requests and web scraping.

Alert Bot: 
    Sends alerts to a Telegram group when ad balance thresholds are breached.

Main Script: 
    Orchestrates the collection of data and sending of alerts.

1. Scraper
    Module Overview:
        The scraper is responsible for collecting ad balance data from various ad platforms. 
        The data is pulled from Google Sheets and external APIs, 
        and the results are stored and returned as a list of dictionaries.

    Functionality:
        Fetches ad balance data for multiple platforms: Adsterra, TrafficStars, PropellerAds, etc.
        Uses Google Sheets API to retrieve configuration and threshold data.
        Collects balance data based on the platform.
        Each platform has a dedicated function for fetching balance data (e.g., sendRequestADS, sendRequestTRAFF).

    Key Functions:
        collect_ads_balance()
        Purpose: Collects ad balance data for multiple platforms.
        Parameters: None
        Returns: A list of dictionaries with collected data, including:
            brand: Brand name
            platform: Platform name (e.g., Adsterra, TrafficStars, etc.)
            balance: Current balance of the ad account
            currency: Currency of the balance
            threshold_low: Minimum threshold for alerts

        Key Components:
            Google Sheets API: Fetches data such as platform names, account info, and thresholds.
            Platform-specific functions: Sends requests to various ad platforms to get balance data (e.g., sendRequestADS, sendRequestTRAFF).

        Platform-specific functions (e.g., sendRequestADS, sendRequestTRAFF)
            Purpose: Communicates with external APIs or services to fetch balance data for each platform.
            Parameters: Varies by platform (usually a URL and API key or credentials).
            Returns: A dictionary containing the balance information.

2. Alert Bot
    Module Overview
        The Alert Bot sends alerts to a Telegram group whenever an ad balance goes below a specified threshold. 
        The bot checks for critical and high alerts, formats the alert message, and sends it asynchronously.

    Functionality
        Sends alerts to a Telegram group using the python-telegram-bot library.
        Formats alert messages and sends them in chunks if they exceed the Telegram message length limit.
        Alerts are sent based on ad balance thresholds specified in the Google Sheets configuration.

    Key Functions:
        send_alert(data)
            Purpose: Processes and sends alert messages asynchronously.
            
            Parameters:
                data: A list of dictionaries containing ad balance data.
            Returns: None

            Process:
                Loops through the data list.
                Checks if the balance is below the specified threshold.
                If the balance is below the threshold, the alert message is formatted and added to the list of alert messages.

        send_chunked_messages(messages, max_length=4000)
            Purpose: Sends a list of messages split into chunks if they exceed Telegramâ€™s message length limit (4000 characters).

            Parameters:
                messages: List of alert messages to be sent.
                max_length: Maximum allowed length for each Telegram message (default is 4000 characters).

            Returns: None

            Process:
                Combines messages until the chunk exceeds the max length.
                Sends each chunk separately if the length exceeds the max limit.

        send_message(message)
            Purpose: Sends a single alert message to the Telegram group.

            Parameters:
                message: The alert message to be sent.

            Returns: None

            Process:
                Uses the Telegram Bot API to send the alert message to the specified group.

        format_message(data)
            Purpose: Formats the alert message.

            Parameters:
                data: A dictionary containing information about the ad balance.

            Returns: A formatted string that represents the alert message.

3. Main Script
    Module Overview
        The main script orchestrates the entire process: it collects ad balance data, processes alerts, and sends the alerts via Telegram.

    Functionality
        Loads environment variables (Telegram Bot token and group/channel ID).
        Calls the collect_ads_balance() function to fetch data.
        Initializes the MediaBot class to send alerts to the Telegram group.
        Uses asyncio to send alerts asynchronously.

    Key Functions:
        main()
            Purpose: Orchestrates the entire process by calling the scraper to collect data, and then sending alerts.

            Parameters: None

            Returns: None

            Process:
                Calls collect_ads_balance() to gather ad balance data.
                Initializes the MediaBot and sends alerts asynchronously via send_alert().
